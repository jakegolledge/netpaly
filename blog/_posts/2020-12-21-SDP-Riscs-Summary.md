# Welcome
**hello world**, seeing as this is the first blog post on the Net Paladin site, I figured I would use this as a platform to test out some new technologies that I have been up this point unfamiliar with.

With that in mind, this will mark my first endeavour into a intensive usage of Vim, Jekyll and blogging in general, so please do be patient and contact me at liam@netpaladin.co.uk - as we have yet to install a comment section - if you have any queries about the contents described in these posts, or simply any corrections or ammendments you think are worthwhile (typos included).

Without further adu, I'll embark on the journey of summarising the five break out groups that occured at the RISCS event on the 9th of November 2021. This opinions and takes are representitive of my own, and not any affiliated institutions and organisations.

# Summary of the SDP Breakout Rooms
These are the a breakdown of the main themes and notes of the padlets for each break out room discussion.
